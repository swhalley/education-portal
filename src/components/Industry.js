          Are your kids taking the right courses? How is the industry growing
          around us and will there be jobs when you or your child leaves school?
          I want to look at what courses kids are taking and does that fit where
          the industry is moving? Are there too many kids taking Automotive,
          when the technology sectors are growing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to perform this analysis I will want a breakdown of all the
          classes at the senior high level and how many kids are in each class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at job creation and the rest of the economy, can there be a
          push to create higher paying jobs and direct kids into industries with
          openings.
